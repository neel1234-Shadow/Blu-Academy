            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>
                The Israel-Palestine conflict is one of the most complex and enduring disputes in modern history. It revolves 
                around issues of land, identity, and governance, with deep-rooted religious, political, and cultural significance.

            <h2>Historical Background</h2>
            <p>
                The conflict traces back to the early 20th century during the decline of the Ottoman Empire. The establishment 
                of the State of Israel in 1948, the subsequent wars, and the displacement of Palestinian communities have been 
                pivotal moments in the conflict's history.

        <section id="perspectives" class="section">
            <h2>Perspectives</h2>
            <p>
                From the Israeli perspective, the land is their historic and religious homeland. Security and recognition 
                from neighboring states are critical concerns. The Palestinian perspective emphasizes their displacement, 
                rights to self-determination, and the challenges of occupation in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.

            <h2>Current Situation</h2>
            <p>
                Tensions continue with periodic escalations of violence. The blockade of Gaza, settlement expansions in 
                the West Bank, and human rights issues remain significant points of contention. International intervention 
                has yet to yield a lasting solution.

        <section id="peace-efforts" class="section">
            <h2>Peace Efforts</h2>
            <p>
                Multiple peace initiatives, including the Oslo Accords and the two-state solution proposal, have sought to 
                address the conflict. Despite setbacks, many organizations and individuals continue to advocate for dialogue 
                and mutual understanding.
