        <!-- Origins Section -->
        <section id="origins">
            <h2>Origins of the Samurai</h2>
            <p>
                The Samurai, or "bushi," were the military nobility and officer caste of medieval and early-modern Japan. Their origins can be traced back to the Heian period (794–1185 CE), when provincial clans organized warriors to protect their lands and maintain order. Over time, these warriors evolved into a distinct social class that became central to Japan's feudal system.
            </p>
            <p>
                The rise of the Samurai was fueled by the instability of the Heian court, which led to the prominence of regional warlords. Samurai families like the Minamoto and Taira gained influence and power, culminating in the Genpei War (1180–1185), a pivotal conflict that established the first shogunate under Minamoto no Yoritomo.
            </p>

        <!-- Bushido Code Section -->
        <section id="code">
            <h2>The Bushido Code</h2>
            <p>
                The Samurai adhered to a strict code of ethics known as "Bushido," or the "Way of the Warrior." This code emphasized loyalty, honor, and discipline, shaping the moral and social framework of Samurai life. Key principles of Bushido included:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Rectitude:</strong> The ability to make the right decision without wavering.</li>
                <li><strong>Courage:</strong> Facing danger and adversity with valor.</li>
                <li><strong>Benevolence:</strong> Kindness and generosity, even to one's enemies.</li>
                <li><strong>Respect:</strong> Politeness and consideration for others.</li>
                <li><strong>Honesty:</strong> Living with integrity and avoiding deceit.</li>
                <li><strong>Honor:</strong> Upholding one's reputation and duty.</li>
                <li><strong>Loyalty:</strong> Devotion to one's lord and family.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                These principles were immortalized in literature and the arts, becoming a cornerstone of Japanese culture.
            </p>
        </section>

        <!-- Edo Period Section -->
        <section id="edo">
            <h2>The Edo Period</h2>
            <p>
                During the Edo period (1603–1868), Japan experienced a prolonged era of peace under the Tokugawa shogunate. With fewer wars to fight, the role of the Samurai shifted from warriors to administrators and scholars. They became the enforcers of Tokugawa policies and the keepers of Japanese tradition.
            </p>
            <p>
                Samurai were required to master not only martial arts but also the pen. They studied literature, philosophy, and art, embodying the ideal of the "scholar-warrior." Despite this cultural evolution, the Samurai faced challenges as economic changes eroded their traditional status.
            </p>
        </section>

        <!-- Samurai Culture Section -->
        <section id="culture">
            <h2>Samurai Culture</h2>
            <p>
                Samurai culture was deeply rooted in discipline, education, and the arts. They were patrons of poetry, calligraphy, and tea ceremonies, reflecting their refined tastes. Samurai armor and swords were masterpieces of craftsmanship, blending functionality with aesthetic beauty.
            </p>
            <p>
                One of the most iconic symbols of Samurai culture was the katana, a curved, single-edged sword that epitomized their skill and honor. Samurai families often passed down these weapons as treasured heirlooms, embedding them with stories and spiritual significance.
            </p>
        </section>

        <!-- Legacy Section -->
        <section id="legacy">
            <h2>The Legacy of the Samurai</h2>
            <p>
                Although the Samurai class was officially abolished during the Meiji Restoration in the late 19th century, their legacy endures. Their ideals of honor, discipline, and loyalty continue to inspire Japanese society and popular culture worldwide.
            </p>
            <p>
                Films, literature, and art have romanticized the Samurai, presenting them as heroic figures embodying the spirit of Japan. The influence of Samurai philosophy can be seen in modern martial arts, business practices, and leadership principles.
