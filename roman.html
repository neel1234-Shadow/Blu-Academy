        <section id="origins">
            <h2>Origins of Rome</h2>
            <p>
                The origins of Rome are steeped in legend and myth. According to Roman tradition, the city was founded in 753 BCE by Romulus, 
                one of the twin sons of Mars and the Vestal Virgin Rhea Silvia. Raised by a she-wolf, Romulus and his brother Remus grew to 
                overthrow their uncle and establish the city on the Palatine Hill. Archaeological evidence suggests that settlements in 
                the area date back to the 10th century BCE, reflecting a mix of Latin, Sabine, and Etruscan cultures.
            </p>
            <p>
                Romeâ€™s early development was heavily influenced by the Etruscans, who contributed to its urban planning, religious practices, 
                and architectural techniques. This period set the stage for the rise of the Roman Republic.
            </p>

        <!-- Roman Republic Section -->
        <section id="republic">
            <h2>The Roman Republic</h2>
            <p>
                The Roman Republic was established in 509 BCE after the overthrow of the last Etruscan king, Tarquin the Proud. It was characterized 
                by a complex system of checks and balances, with power shared between elected officials, the Senate, and popular assemblies. 
                The Republic saw significant territorial expansion, including the conquest of Italy, the Punic Wars against Carthage, 
                and conflicts with Hellenistic kingdoms.
            </p>
            <p>
                Key figures during this period included Cincinnatus, who symbolized the ideals of civic duty, and Julius Caesar, whose crossing of the 
                Rubicon marked the end of the Republic and the rise of autocratic rule. The assassination of Caesar in 44 BCE underscored the tensions 
                that ultimately led to the establishment of the Roman Empire.
            </p>

        <!-- Roman Empire Section -->
        <section id="empire">
            <h2>The Roman Empire</h2>
            <p>
                The Roman Empire began in 27 BCE when Augustus, formerly known as Octavian, became the first emperor. Under Augustus, Rome entered a 
                period of peace and prosperity known as the Pax Romana, which lasted for over two centuries. The Empire stretched from Britain 
                to Mesopotamia, encompassing a vast and diverse population.
            </p>
            <p>
                Key events during this period include the reign of emperors such as Nero, Hadrian, and Constantine. The latter legalized Christianity 
                and moved the capital to Byzantium, later renamed Constantinople. Despite its strength, the Empire faced internal strife and external 
                pressures, leading to the fall of the Western Roman Empire in 476 CE.

        <!-- Roman Culture Section -->
        <section id="culture">
            <h2>Roman Culture</h2>
            <p>
                Roman culture was a blend of Greek, Etruscan, and native influences. Its contributions to architecture, engineering, and law remain 
                foundational to Western civilization. The Romans built enduring structures such as the Colosseum, aqueducts, and roads, showcasing 
                their engineering prowess.
            </p>
            <p>
                Roman literature, art, and philosophy were heavily influenced by Greek traditions. Writers such as Virgil, Ovid, and Seneca explored 
                themes of heroism, love, and stoicism. Roman religion initially mirrored Greek deities but evolved with the adoption of Christianity 
                as the state religion in the 4th century CE.
            </p>

        <!-- Legacy Section -->
        <section id="legacy">
            <h2>The Legacy of Rome</h2>
            <p>
                Rome's legacy is evident in modern law, government, language, and infrastructure. Concepts like the Republic, legal codes, and 
                civic duty have shaped democratic systems worldwide. Latin, the language of Rome, influenced the development of Romance 
                languages and scientific terminology.
            </p>
            <p>
                The idea of Rome as an eternal city continues to inspire. Its achievements in architecture, engineering, and governance serve as 
                a testament to the ingenuity and resilience of one of history's greatest civilizations.
