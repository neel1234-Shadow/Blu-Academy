            <h2>Causes of World War One</h2>
            <p>
                The causes of World War One, also known as the Great War, are complex and interwoven, involving political, military, and 
                social factors. The assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria-Hungary on June 28, 1914, is often cited as the 
                immediate trigger of the war, but deeper issues like militarism, alliances, imperialism, and nationalism had been building 
                tension for decades.
            </p>
            <p>
                Militarism played a key role, with nations like Germany, Britain, and France significantly increasing their military budgets 
                and capabilities. The naval arms race between Germany and Britain is a prime example of this competitive buildup. 
                Alliances like the Triple Entente (France, Russia, and Britain) and the Triple Alliance (Germany, Austria-Hungary, and Italy) 
                created a fragile balance of power, where a conflict involving one nation could quickly escalate to involve others.
            </p>
            <p>
                Imperial rivalries further deepened tensions, as major powers competed for colonies and influence worldwide. Nationalism, 
                particularly in the Balkans, where Slavic groups sought independence from Austro-Hungarian rule, added fuel to the fire. 
                The combination of these factors created a powder keg that was ignited by the events in Sarajevo in 1914.

            <h2>Key Battles of World War One</h2>
            <p>
                World War One was marked by several significant battles that shaped the course of the war and demonstrated the devastating 
                impact of modern warfare. Among the most notable are the Battle of the Marne, the Battle of Verdun, and the Battle of the Somme.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Battle of the Marne, fought in September 1914, was a critical Allied victory that halted the German advance into France 
                and set the stage for trench warfare. The Battle of Verdun in 1916 was one of the longest and costliest battles of the war, 
                with French and German forces suffering over 700,000 casualties combined.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Battle of the Somme, also in 1916, is infamous for its staggering loss of life. On the first day alone, the British Army 
                suffered over 57,000 casualties. Despite the heavy toll, these battles demonstrated the resilience and determination of both 
                sides in a war that would redefine modern combat.

            <h2>Technology in World War One</h2>
            <p>
                World War One saw the introduction of many technological advancements that transformed the nature of warfare. Machine guns, 
                tanks, poison gas, and airplanes were among the new weapons that brought unprecedented levels of destruction to the battlefield.
            </p>
            <p>
                Trench warfare became a hallmark of the conflict, with soldiers enduring harsh conditions in the trenches. Barbed wire and 
                artillery made traditional charges across "No Man's Land" incredibly deadly. Poison gas, first used by Germany in 1915, 
                added a horrifying new dimension to the war.
            </p>
            <p>
                The development of tanks by the British provided a way to break through entrenched positions, though their early use was 
                limited by mechanical issues. Airplanes, initially used for reconnaissance, became integral to warfare, leading to the 
                first dogfights and aerial bombings in history.

        <!-- Aftermath Section -->
        <section id="aftermath">
            <h2>Aftermath of World War One</h2>
            <p>
                The aftermath of World War One reshaped the political and social landscape of the world. The war officially ended on 
                November 11, 1918, with the signing of the Armistice, but its consequences would be felt for decades.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Treaty of Versailles, signed in 1919, imposed harsh penalties on Germany, including territorial losses, military 
                restrictions, and reparations payments. This created economic and political instability that contributed to the rise of 
                fascism and the outbreak of World War Two.
            </p>
            <p>
                The war also led to the collapse of empires like the Austro-Hungarian, Ottoman, and Russian empires, paving the way for 
                new nations and movements for self-determination. Socially, the war brought significant changes, including the 
                empowerment of women, who took on new roles during the conflict.
