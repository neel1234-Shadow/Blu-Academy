            <h2>Ancient Egypt</h2>
            <p>
                Ancient Egypt is one of the most fascinating civilizations in human history. With its origins dating back to around 3100 BCE,
                it developed along the fertile Nile River, which provided a lifeline for its people. Known for its monumental architecture, 
                such as the Pyramids of Giza and the Sphinx, Ancient Egypt was a society of incredible innovation and spirituality.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Old Kingdom (2686–2181 BCE) is renowned for the construction of the pyramids. These massive structures, built as tombs
                for Pharaohs, symbolize the Egyptians' strong belief in the afterlife. The Great Pyramid of Giza, one of the Seven Wonders 
                of the Ancient World, still stands today as a testament to their engineering prowess.
            </p>
            <p>
                Religion played a central role in Ancient Egyptian society. They worshiped a vast pantheon of gods and goddesses, each
                representing natural forces and aspects of daily life. Ra, the sun god, was one of the most revered deities, and the Pharaoh 
                was considered his earthly embodiment.

        <section id="middle-kingdom">
            <h2>Middle Kingdom</h2>
            <p>
                The Middle Kingdom (2055–1650 BCE) is often referred to as the "Golden Age" of Ancient Egypt. During this period, Egypt 
                experienced political stability, economic prosperity, and cultural flourishing. The capital was moved to Thebes, and the 
                Pharaohs worked to restore unity after the decline of the Old Kingdom.
            </p>
            <p>
                Literature, art, and architecture thrived during this era. The "Tale of Sinuhe," one of the earliest known pieces of 
                literature, was composed during the Middle Kingdom. Egyptian art became more refined, with intricate sculptures and 
                beautifully decorated tombs reflecting their advanced skills.

            <h2>New Kingdom</h2>
            <p>
                The New Kingdom (1550–1070 BCE) is often regarded as the height of Ancient Egyptian power and influence. It was during this
                period that Egypt became an empire, extending its control over neighboring regions. Pharaohs like Hatshepsut, Akhenaten, 
                Tutankhamun, and Ramses II played significant roles in shaping the history of this era.
            </p>
            <p>
                Ramses II, often called "Ramses the Great," is one of the most celebrated Pharaohs of the New Kingdom. His reign was marked
                by military conquests, massive building projects, and the signing of the first recorded peace treaty with the Hittites.
                The temples of Abu Simbel, built under his rule, are among Egypt's most iconic landmarks.

            <h2>Modern Egypt</h2>
            <p>
                Modern Egypt is a blend of its ancient legacy and contemporary development. After gaining independence in the mid-20th 
                century, Egypt has grown into a regional powerhouse. The Nile River continues to be a lifeline for the country, supporting 
                agriculture, transportation, and tourism.
            </p>
            <p>
                Today, Egypt is known for its rich history, vibrant culture, and iconic landmarks like the pyramids and temples. The 
                preservation of these historical sites is a priority, as they attract millions of visitors every year and contribute to the 
                nation's economy.
