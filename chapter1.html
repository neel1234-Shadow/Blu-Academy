        <h2>What is Robotics?</h2>
        <p>Robotics is the intersection of science, engineering, and technology that produces machines, called robots, that substitute for (or replicate) human actions. Robots are often used to perform tasks that are either too dangerous, repetitive, or require precision that humans cannot achieve consistently.</p>
        
        <h2>The History of Robotics</h2>
        <p>The concept of automating human-like tasks dates back thousands of years. Ancient Greek mythology features automata, such as Talos, a giant bronze automaton created by the god Hephaestus. In the Middle Ages, engineers in the Islamic world developed mechanical devices capable of performing complex movements, such as the elephant clock created by Al-Jazari in the 13th century.</p>
        <p>Modern robotics began with the industrial revolution, particularly with the development of mechanized looms and automated systems. By the 20th century, the invention of the microprocessor and advancements in computer science allowed robots to become programmable, enabling the automation of complex manufacturing processes.</p>

        <h2>Applications of Robotics</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Manufacturing:</strong> Robots are widely used in automotive assembly lines and electronics manufacturing for tasks like welding, painting, and assembling.</li>
            <li><strong>Healthcare:</strong> Robotic systems such as da Vinci Surgical Systems assist surgeons in performing minimally invasive procedures with high precision.</li>
            <li><strong>Space Exploration:</strong> NASA's Mars rovers like Spirit, Opportunity, and Perseverance explore distant planets autonomously.</li>
            <li><strong>Military:</strong> Robots are deployed for surveillance, bomb disposal, and reconnaissance in hostile environments.</li>
            <li><strong>Service Industry:</strong> Robots assist with cleaning, hospitality, and even personal assistance for individuals with disabilities.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Types of Robots</h2>
        <p>Robots come in various shapes and sizes, each designed for specific tasks and environments. Here are the main types:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Industrial Robots:</strong> Found in factories and assembly lines, these robots are programmed for tasks like welding, packaging, and material handling.</li>
            <li><strong>Humanoid Robots:</strong> Designed to resemble and imitate human actions, these robots are used for customer service, research, and even companionship.</li>
            <li><strong>Autonomous Robots:</strong> These operate without human intervention, using sensors and algorithms to navigate and perform tasks, such as self-driving cars.</li>
            <li><strong>Medical Robots:</strong> Designed for surgeries, diagnostics, and patient care, these robots include surgical arms and rehabilitation aids.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>The Future of Robotics</h2>
        <p>The future of robotics lies in advancing AI and machine learning, which will enable robots to learn, adapt, and improve their capabilities autonomously. Innovations such as soft robotics, humanoid robots, and robotic swarms are expected to revolutionize industries, including healthcare, agriculture, and transportation.</p>
        <p>Additionally, the integration of robots with the Internet of Things (IoT) will allow seamless interaction and coordination between robots and other devices, making them smarter and more efficient in various applications.</p>

        <h2>Ethical Considerations</h2>
        <p>As robots become more integrated into society, ethical questions arise regarding their use. These include concerns about job displacement, privacy, and the potential misuse of robots for harmful purposes. Ensuring ethical guidelines and regulations will be crucial in mitigating risks and maximizing benefits.</p>
