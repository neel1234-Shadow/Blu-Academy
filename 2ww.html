            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>
                World War Two, also known as the Second World War, was a global conflict that lasted from 1939 to 1945. 
                It involved the majority of the world's nations, forming two opposing military alliances: the Allies and the Axis. 
                It is widely regarded as the deadliest conflict in human history, resulting in an estimated 70-85 million fatalities, 
                including civilians and military personnel.
            </p>
            <p>
                The war reshaped the political, economic, and social landscape of the 20th century, leading to the rise of 
                the United States and the Soviet Union as superpowers and the establishment of the United Nations.

        <section id="causes">
            <h2>Causes of World War Two</h2>
            <p>
                The causes of World War Two were rooted in unresolved issues from World War One and the Treaty of Versailles. 
                Germany's harsh reparations, territorial losses, and economic instability fueled resentment and the rise of Adolf Hitler. 
                Japan's expansionist ambitions in Asia, Italy's desire for imperial power, and the failure of the League of Nations 
                to prevent aggression also contributed to the outbreak of the war.
            </p>
            <p>
                Other factors include the global Great Depression, which created widespread unemployment and social unrest, 
                and the policy of appeasement pursued by Britain and France, which emboldened aggressive actions by Germany and Japan.

        <!-- Impact Section -->
        <section id="impact">
            <h2>Impact of World War Two</h2>
            <p>
                The war resulted in significant political, economic, and social changes worldwide. The destruction of infrastructure, 
                cities, and industries across Europe and Asia left a lasting impact. The Holocaust, which claimed the lives of six 
                million Jews, highlighted the horrors of genocide and led to international efforts to prevent such atrocities in the future.
            </p>
            <p>
                The war also accelerated advancements in technology and warfare, including the development of nuclear weapons. 
                It marked the beginning of the Cold War as ideological differences between the United States and the Soviet Union 
                shaped the post-war world.

        <!-- Aftermath Section -->
        <section id="aftermath">
            <h2>Aftermath of World War Two</h2>
            <p>
                The aftermath of World War Two saw the establishment of the United Nations in 1945 to promote international 
                cooperation and prevent future conflicts. The Marshall Plan provided economic aid to rebuild war-torn Europe. 
                Germany was divided into East and West, while the Iron Curtain symbolized the growing divide between the 
                Soviet-controlled East and the democratic West.
            </p>
            <p>
                Decolonization gained momentum, as former colonies in Asia, Africa, and the Middle East sought independence. 
                The war also led to advancements in civil rights movements and the recognition of the need for global cooperation 
                to address challenges such as poverty and conflict.
